# OpenChara

An open character framework for Minecraft Bedrock add-ons. OpenChara is the *systems*: a crash-safe character database, squads and tactical AI, pathfinding, stats/leveling/relationships/quests, and a UI base. What those characters actually *are*, including names, classes, abilities, quests, UI layouts and art, comes from a separate **project** made of patch files.

You write a project's `PATCHES/` folder. OpenChara builds it, together with the engine, into a normal behavior pack + resource pack.

A [Codex Alchemist](https://github.com/codex-alchemist-dev) project, under Fireball Everything. See [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md).

## What's in the engine

- **Character database:** each character is data the player owns, not an entity. It uses A/B rollback slots, a checksummed world-scoped mirror copy, copy-validate-commit writes, schema migrations, an integrity scan/repair that runs on join, soft-delete with a trash bin, export/import backups, ownership transfer, and gameplay counters.
- **Characters in the world:** the in-world entity is a disposable avatar that can be manifested, recalled or teleported at any time. Characters follow their player across dimensions, and duplicate avatars clean themselves up. A heavily damaged character is knocked out rather than killed.
- **Progression:** levels/XP, skill trees, eidolons, relationship tracks, character-to-character bonds, quests (with a shared condition registry), gifts, and soul tokens.
- **Squads and tactics:**
  - Standing orders (follow/stay/wander/home) and real native pathfinding to any coordinate.
  - Terrain-aware formations and perception (line of sight, threat memory, blind spots).
  - Squad coordination: target saturation and posture.
  - CQB playbooks: breach, room clear, slice the pie.
  - Hunting that cuts off the prey's escape routes first, and multi-squad army coordination.
- **Custom UI system** ([docs/UI.md](docs/UI.md)):
  - An HTML/CSS-like screen language compiled to JSON UI, with templates, loops, conditions, animations and actions.
  - Menus with navigation, pickers and dialogue, plus a persistent per-player HUD and chest-style container screens.
  - An RTS command mode.
  - Per-player languages.
  - Auto-generated character portraits cut from skins.

## Using it

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 18+ (no npm packages needed).

```bash
node tools/openchara.js dev    "../My Project"   # build + deploy to Minecraft's dev folders, then auto-redeploy on every change
node tools/openchara.js check  "../My Project"   # build + validate only
node tools/openchara.js build  "../My Project"   # write the packs to <project>/build/
node tools/openchara.js export "../My Project"   # write <project>/dist/<Name> <version>.mcaddon
```

`dev` watches both your project's `PATCHES/` and this engine folder, so a `git pull` here is picked up automatically too. Every build is validated before it's deployed: JSON is parsed, JS is syntax-checked, every import is resolved, and the compiled JSON UI is linted for known silent-failure patterns. A broken build never reaches your game; one bad import would otherwise silently kill the whole script pack.

If something still misbehaves only in-game, `node tools/openchara.js log <projectDir>` reads Minecraft's own content log (JSON UI and entity errors never show up any other way) filtered to your project; add `--follow` to tail it live, `--all` to see every pack.

After a script change, run `/reload` in-game. New entities, items or textures need you to rejoin the world.
